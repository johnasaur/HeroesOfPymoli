Written description of three observable trends based on the data:

1.	The majority of the clientele gender-wise is male with the count of 633 and the price around $1868, as opposed to female count of 136 and the price of $383. Interesting trend coming out of it was that the average price was very close in numbers, despite the fact that the gender population and prices differed greatly.
2.	Most of the players, male and female alike, are in the 20-24 age range and the least are in 40+ age range. Interestingly, the average purchase price was highest with those of under age of 10. The total price had the biggest gap between ages 20-24 and the rest of the population ages. 
3.	Most popular games appeared to be purchased by those in their 20s and 30s, mostly by males.
